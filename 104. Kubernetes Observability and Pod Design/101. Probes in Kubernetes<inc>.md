# Probes in Kubernetes

This assignment has three separate tasks involving readiness, liveness, and startup probes for managing different lifecycle aspects of Kubernetes pods. By configuring different probes to manage pod lifecycle events effectively, you can enhance the robustness and reliability of Kubernetes applications.

Name of file: multi-probe-app.yaml **,**
Name of the pod: multi-probe-app

### TASK 1: Readiness Probe Configuration
Ensure the web application becomes available to serve traffic only when it is fully ready.

Container Name: web-app
Container Image: nginx:latest
Probe Type: readinessProbe
Behavior: Uses an HTTP GET request to verify the application is serving content. This ensures Kubernetes routes traffic only when NGINX is fully ready.
Initial Delay: 2 seconds
Check Interval: Every 5 seconds

---

### TASK 2: Liveness Probe Configuration
Ensure the API service is restarted automatically if it becomes unhealthy.

Container Name: api-service
Container Image: busybox
Probe Type: livenessProbe
Behavior: Periodically checks for the presence of a /tmp/healthy file. If the file is removed (simulating a failure), the container will be restarted.
Initial Delay: 3 seconds
Check Interval: Every 5 seconds
Failure Threshold: 2 consecutive failures before restart

---

### TASK 3: Startup Probe Configuration
Handle the slow startup behavior of a background application.

Container Name: slow-start-app
Container Image: busybox
Probe Type: startupProbe
Behavior: Waits for a /tmp/startup file to appear before marking the application as started. This prevents premature liveness or readiness checks.
Initial Delay: 5 seconds
Check Interval: Every 3 seconds
Failure Threshold: 3 retries before considering startup as failed
