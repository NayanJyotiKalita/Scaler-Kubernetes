# Deployment Strategy in Kubernetes

### Objective

You have an existing Kubernetes application running in the Blue environment, which is already fully configured and serving production traffic through a Service named nginx-service.

---

### TASK 1: 
Set up the Green environment, which will include:

- Serving a different version of content (e.g., a new index.html) using a ConfigMap.
- Deploying a new version of the application using Nginx.

Index.html content for green deployment: 
```html
<h1>Green</h1>
```

---

## TASK 2: 
Ensure the Green deployment runs in parallel with the Blue version without interfering with existing traffic.

There should be :
<br>Name of Mount: green-config
<br>Replicas: 2
<br>Volume Mount path: : /usr/share/nginx/html

---

### TASK 3: 
Switch production traffic from Blue to Green by updating the nginx-service selector once the Green environment is verified to be working correctly.
