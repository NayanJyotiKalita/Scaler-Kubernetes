# Replicaset in Kubernetes

## Objective

This assignment aims to understand the concept of Replica Sets in Kubernetes by creating a Pod with a specific label and then creating a Replica Set that manages this Pod using the same label. This assignment will demonstrate how Replica Sets can manage Pods, even those not created by the Replica Set itself.

---

### TASK 1: Create a Namespace

Create a new Namespace called replica-set-namespace. Verify that the Namespace is created successfully.

---

### TASK 2: Create a Pod with a Label

Define a Pod in a YAML file labeled-pod.yaml with the following specifications:

- The Pod should be named labeled-pod.
- It should run in the replica-set-namespace.
- The Pod should include one container running the nginx image.
- Add a label to the Pod app: my-app.
- Apply the YAML file to create the Pod.
- Verify that the Pod is created successfully and has the correct label.

---

### TASK 3: Create a Replica Set

Define a Replica Set in a YAML file replica-set.yaml with the following specifications:

- The Replica Set should be named my-app-replicaset.
- It should run in the replica-set-namespace.
- The Replica Set should have a selector that matches the label app: my-app.
- The Replica Set should specify replicas: 3 to ensure three replicas of the Pod.
- The Replica Set should use the same Pod template as the initially created Pod.
- Apply the YAML file to create the Replica Set.

---

### TASK 4: Verify Replica Set Management

Use kubectl commands to verify that the Replica Set recognizes and manages the initially created Pod. Verify the status and details of the Pods managed by the Replica Set.
