# Pods in Kubernetes

## Objective

This assignment aims to demonstrate an understanding of Pods in Kubernetes by creating and managing Pods using kubectl. You will create a multi-container Pod and deploy a simple application with a main application container and a logging sidecar container.

---

### TASK 1: Create a Namespace

Create a new Namespace called assignment-namespace using yaml. Verify that the Namespace is created successfully.

---

### TASK 2: Create a Multi-Container Pod

Define a Pod in a YAML file multi-container-pod.yaml with the following specifications:

- The Pod should be named web-server-pod.
- It should run in the assignment-namespace.
- The Pod should include two containers:
-> nginx-container: Runs the nginx image and exposes port 80.
-> log-sidecar: Runs the busybox image with a command to tail the nginx access log file.
- Both containers store the log files using a shared volume emptyDir.
- Apply the YAML file to create the Pod.

---

### TASK 3: Verify Pod Creation

Use kubectl commands to verify that the Pod is running correctly. Check the status of the containers within the Pod.

---

### TASK 4: Access the Nginx Application

Use kubectl port-forward to access the Nginx application running in the nginx-container from your local machine. Verify that you can access the Nginx welcome page by making a curl request to http://localhost:<forwarded-port>.

---

### TASK 5: View Logs from the Log Sidecar

Use kubectl logs to view the logs generated by the log-sidecar container. Verify that the logs contain access logs from the Nginx application.
