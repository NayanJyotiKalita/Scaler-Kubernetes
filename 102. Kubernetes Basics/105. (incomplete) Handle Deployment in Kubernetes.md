# Handle Deployment in Kubernetes

## Objective

This assignment aims to understand how to update a Deployment and handle update failures in Kubernetes.

### TASK 1: Update the Deployment

Update the existing Deployment to use a non-existent image nginx:wrong-image to simulate an update failure.

- Make the relevant changes in the nginx-deployment.yaml file.
- Verify that the update causes errors and that the Pods fail to start.
