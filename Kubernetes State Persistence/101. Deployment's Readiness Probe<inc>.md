# Deployment's Readiness Probe

### Objective

Your team is tasked with ensuring that a web application, deployed using Kubernetes, is ready to serve traffic only when a specific endpoint is fully operational. The solution involves setting up a Deployment and Service named "web-app" in the default namespace, utilizing the nginx:latest image, and incorporating a readiness probe that sends an HTTP GET request to the "/" endpoint to confirm the application's readiness to handle traffic.

### TASK - 1: Create the Deployment with the readiness probe

- Open a YAML configuration file named web-app-deployment.yaml.
- Set the metadata with the name web-app and specify the default namespace.
- Configure the Deployment to have 3 replicas of the application, ensuring high availability.
- Use a selector with the label app: web-app to manage the pods under this Deployment.
- In the pod template, specify the container to run using the nginx:latest image.
- Define a readiness probe within the container specification:Configure the probe to perform an HTTP GET request to the path / on port 80.
- Set an initial delay of 5 seconds before the probe starts, allowing the application to start up.
- Specify the probe to run every 5 seconds.
- Allow a timeout of 1 second for each probe.
- Set the success threshold to 1, meaning the probe needs to succeed once to consider the container ready.
- Set the failure threshold to 3, allowing the probe to fail up to three times before the container is marked as unready.

### TASK - 2: Verify the Deployment's readiness status

- Instructions: Check the status of the pods
- Look for the READY column in the output to check if the readiness probes have succeeded and the pods are ready to serve traffic.
- Monitor the Deployment: Continuously monitor the readiness status to ensure that all replicas are serving traffic as expected.
