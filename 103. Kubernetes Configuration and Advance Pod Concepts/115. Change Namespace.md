# Change Namespace

## TASK:

Team 1 decided to take control over one of Team 2's web server. The administrator who once set up this webserver is no longer part of the organization. All information you could get was that the web server is called server1.

Please search for the correct Pod in Namespace t1 and move it to Namespace t2. It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again.
